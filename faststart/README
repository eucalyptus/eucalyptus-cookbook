Faststart for Cloud-in-a-box!

To install your Eucalyptus cloud on a CentOS/RHEL 6.5 system, run the following
on the command line:

bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus-cookbook/master/faststart/cloud-in-a-box.sh)

A few notes:
* Must run as root;
* Must have curl installed;
* Must have internet access;
* Must have a fixed IP address for the host (i.e. no DHCP);
* Must have some IP addresses set aside on the local network;

Once the installation is complete, you can access the "Eucaconsole" web console on port 8888.
